# MySQL_Database_Project

## Overview
A full-stack database-driven application built with Node.js, Express, Handlebars (templating), and MySQL. Originally inspired by a Node.js starter app and tailored for custom CRUD operations. It features dynamic tables enhanced with CSS styling, a responsive navigation bar, and MySQL integration.

  - Navigation bar adapted from W3Schools—a responsive, user-friendly UI.
- **Node.js Foundation**: Forked or based on OSU’s Node.js exploration project and starter app.
- **Modular & Readable Codebase**: Separation of code across database, pages, views, and app logic.
